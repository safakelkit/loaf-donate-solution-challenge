 # <h1 align="center">Loaf Donate - SOLUTION CHALLENGE 2024</h1>


 ##  Introduction

 The tragic situation of people around the world who cannot find bread, a staple food, is leading to hunger and malnutrition. Bread, a daily necessity for many of us, has become a luxury in some regions, with painful consequences.

Although many aid organizations around the world are trying to help people in these situations, the root of this problem is often complex and difficult to solve.

As GDSC Selçuk University, we aim to prevent this complexity under the category of Zero Hunger and No Poverty and to meet the need for bread with a single platform, Loaf Donate.

We divide the users of the application into three categories: volunteers, people in need and bakers. Volunteers are people who donate or volunteer to help the person in need to access bread. People in need are those who do not have the financial means to buy bread. Bakers are the people who determine the number of bread suspended in their bakeries and provide the necessary information about their bakeries.

We have tested our application many times during the production phase, and we have made significant improvements to make our interface simpler and more user-friendly, especially taking into account the feedback from our elderly users. This valuable feedback has been an important guide for us to increase the overall usability of our app and optimize the user experience.

At the moment, our app seems to be a bit behind our planned target audience. However, thanks to the feedback from users, one of the other goals of our App is to promote friendly competition between regions to bring our App to a wider audience and encourage people to donate more. In this way, we can more effectively solve the problems of access to bread and build solidarity between communities. 


We developed our app using Flutter framework and Material Design. In the future, we plan to integrate Google Maps and Firebase technologies to allow users to find the nearest bakeries. With this integration, users will be able to establish more effective communication between people in need, volunteers and bakers. At the same time, we aim to provide an easy and user-friendly experience for people who want to buy or donate bread.

We plan to store user data in the Firebase database in order to securely manage the transactions carried out through the application. This way, users' personal information will be protected and they will be able to interact on a secure platform.
